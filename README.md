## üöÄ Project Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fazamuttaqien/learning-management-system
    cd learning-management-system
    ```
    *You will typically need two terminal windows/tabs open: one for the backend and one for the frontend.*

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    (From the `learning-management-system` root directory)
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if using yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Set Up Backend Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (`learning-management-system/backend/.env`).
    *   Copy the content below into your `.env` file and fill in the values with your credentials and configurations.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Never share your `.env` file or commit it to a public repository. Ensure `backend/.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file (or `*.env` if `.gitignore` is in the root).

    ```env
    PORT=5000

    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_STRONG_JWT_SECRET_HERE

    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_lms_database_name
    # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection URI

    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
    # Change to your frontend URL if different (e.g., in production)

    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

    PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
    # PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox # or 'live' for production
    ```
    *   **Notes:**
        *   `JWT_SECRET`: Should be a long, strong, random string.
        *   `MONGO_URI`: Adjust to your local MongoDB connection string or your Atlas URI.
        *   `CLIENT_URL`: The URL where your frontend application is running. For React Vite, the default is `http://localhost:5173`.
        *   `CLOUDINARY_*`: Obtain these from your Cloudinary dashboard.
        *   `PAYPAL_*`: Obtain these from your PayPal developer dashboard. `PAYPAL_MODE` is typically `sandbox` for development and `live` for production.

4.  **Run the backend development server:**
    (Make sure you are in the `learning-management-system/backend` directory)
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or your custom start script (e.g., npm start)
    ```
    The backend server should now be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified in `backend/.env`).

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    (From the `learning-management-system` root directory)
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
    *(If you were in the `backend` directory, you might use `cd ../frontend`)*
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if using yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **(Optional) Set Up Frontend Environment Variables:**
    *   If your frontend requires environment variables (e.g., the backend API URL if not proxied), create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (`learning-management-system/frontend/.env`).
    *   Example for Vite (variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`):
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
4.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    (Make sure you are in the `learning-management-system/frontend` directory)
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if using yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The frontend application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default port).
